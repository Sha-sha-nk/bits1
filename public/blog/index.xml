      <description>On a September morning, there was a commotion in American Airlines Flight 11, scheduled to fly from Boston to Los Angeles. The cause of the commotion: four men led by a man called Mohammed Atta. Five men who would later crash the flight into the North tower of the Twin Towers in New York. In the hours to come, three more flights would meet a similar fate; one flying straight into the South tower of the Twin Towers, the other crashing into Pentagon, while the last crashing in a field in Pennsylvania.</description>

      <description>Six and half years ago, in the early months of 2011, a wave of protests spread across the Middle East and North Africa against dictators or elected governments from Tunisia to Iran, calling for better governance or the ouster of dictators who had been incumbent for decades. One such country was Syria, where the Ba’ath party (meaning ‘Renaissance’ in Arabic) was ruling with the Assad family at its head. Hafez al-Assad, a member of the minority Alawite sect, rose to power as the President of Syria in 1971, a position he held till his death in 2000.</description>

      <description>The truth is that men are tired of liberty. Benito Mussolini, the Italian dictator is credited with this statement. Holding the reins of a European power for 21 years, he didn’t start off as an autocratic dictator. In fact, he started off as a Socialist journalist, writing on the principles his father had imbibed into him. This continued till he disagreed with Socialist views on Italy’s entrance into the World War 1.</description>

      <description>Remembering an anti-apartheid legend. In 1964, a man was transported to the dreaded Robben Island Prison, which was to be his home for the next 18 years, his crime being treason against the then apartheid government. The first words he heard from his warders as he entered the prison were, “This is an island. Here you will die.” Over the years, rampant discrimination, physical and mental abuse and hard labour was routine.</description>
